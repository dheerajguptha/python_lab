                                                                                        // 9. Search Phone Number & Email //

➡️ Aim:
To write a Python program that searches for phone numbers (+919900889977) and email addresses (sample@gmail.com) in a text file.

➡️ Algorithm:
• Start the program.  
• Open the text file in read mode.  
• Read the content of the file.  
• Import the regular expression module re.  
• Define regex patterns for phone numbers and email addresses.  
• Use re.findall() to find all matches for phone numbers and emails.  
• Display the found phone numbers and email addresses.  
• Close the file and stop the program.  

➡️ Program:
import re

filename = input("Enter file name: ")
with open(filename, 'r') as f:
    text = f.read()

phone_pattern = re.compile(r'\+?\d{12,13}')
email_pattern = re.compile(r'[a-zA-Z0-9._]+@[a-zA-Z]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}')

phones = phone_pattern.findall(text)
emails = email_pattern.findall(text)

print("Phone Numbers Found:", phones)
print("Email Addresses Found:", emails)

➡️ Result:
Thus the Python program that searches for phone numbers and email addresses in a text file is implemented successfully.
