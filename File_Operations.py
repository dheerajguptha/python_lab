                                                                          // 10. File Operations //

➡️ Aim:
To write a Python program to display the first N lines of a file and find the frequency of a specific word in the file.

➡️ Algorithm:
• Start the program.  
• Accept file name and number of lines (N) from the user.  
• Open the file in read mode.  
• Display the first N lines of the file.  
• Accept a word from the user for frequency count.  
• Read the file content and count the occurrences of the word.  
• Display the frequency.  
• Close the file and stop the program.  

➡️ Program:
filename = input("Enter file name: ")
N = int(input("Enter number of lines to display: "))

with open(filename, 'r') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
    print(f"First {N} lines:")
    for line in lines[:N]:
        print(line, end="")

word = input("\nEnter word to find frequency: ")
text = "".join(lines)
count = text.lower().split().count(word.lower())
print(f"Frequency of '{word}':", count)

➡️ Result:
Thus the Python program that displays the first N lines and counts the frequency of a given word in a file is executed successfully.
