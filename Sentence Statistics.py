                                                                                                       // 5. Sentence Statistics //

➡️ Aim:
To write a Python program that accepts a sentence and finds the number of words, digits, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters.

➡️ Algorithm:
• Start the program.  
• Accept a sentence from the user.  
• Split the sentence into words and count them.  
• Count digits using isdigit().  
• Count uppercase and lowercase letters using isupper() and islower().  
• Display the number of words, digits, uppercase, and lowercase letters.  
• Stop the program.  

➡️ Program:
sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")

words = len(sentence.split())
digits = sum(ch.isdigit() for ch in sentence)
upper = sum(ch.isupper() for ch in sentence)
lower = sum(ch.islower() for ch in sentence)

print("Number of words:", words)
print("Number of digits:", digits)
print("Uppercase letters:", upper)
print("Lowercase letters:", lower)

➡️ Result:
Thus the Python program that finds the number of words, digits, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters in a given sentence is implemented successfully.
